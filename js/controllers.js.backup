		img: "img/40o8KmXJR7qPs7beuqFt_ksg_mou_oct2015.jpg",

		pub_date: "1 January 1970",

		body: "The ICDL Africa team visited Mombasa at the end of October, as part of the trip to Kenya for the ATC Forum. ICDL Foundation CEO Damien O’Sullivan, ICDL Country Manager – Kenya, Etinick Mutinda and ICDL 					Africa Partner Relations Manager, Marie-Claire Walsh were hosted by the Kenya School of Government (KSG), at their Mombasa campus. The meeting was chaired by KSG Director General, Dr. Ludeki Chweya and concluded with the signing of a much anticipated Memorandum of Understanding between ICDL Africa and KSG. The MoU outlines the plan to certify Kenyan public sector staff with ICDL, to match KSG’s need for a high standard of digital skills in the workplace. Increasing the digital literacy levels of the Kenyan public sector will enable services to be delivered more effectively to the wider public. Both ICDL Africa and KSG are committed to creating a ICDL profile that will enhance the competencies of all staff, as Kenya leads     the way as an ICT driven economy in Africa.",
